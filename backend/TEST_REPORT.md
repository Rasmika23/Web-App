## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode  
npm test:watch

# Generate coverage report only
npm run test:coverage
```

## Notes

- The route files show 0% coverage because they are integration layer files that primarily contain Express route definitions
- All business logic in controllers, middleware, and models has 100% test coverage
- The overall coverage of 87.03% significantly exceeds the minimum 5% requirement
- Tests include both positive and negative scenarios with proper error handling validation

## Requirements Met ✅

- ✅ Minimum 5% unit test coverage achieved (87.03%)
- ✅ Test reports generated in multiple formats (HTML, LCOV, Text)
- ✅ Coverage reports available in repository (`coverage/` directory)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering all major backend functionality
